      # service defined in the compose file, including the build process ("docker compose build"). Docker Compose will
      # expect that variable to be defined in the environment where it's being run, and it will throw an error if it is
      # not. For this reason we provide a default value.
      #
      # Docker Compose doesn't allow setting default values based on the current shell's environment, so we can't access
      # current working directory and default to "$(pwd)/config". For this reason we default to the config folder
      # relative to the docker-compose.yml file.
